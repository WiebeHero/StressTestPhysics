# StressTestPhysics
 This project is meant to stress test the physics engines inside of Unity, Unreal, and Godot, compare them with eachother and see which ones performs the best.
 
 
# The testing

## What are you going to test?
 I am curious about how the inner workings of the physics systems work inside of Unity, Unreal and Godot. And i want to stress test them all in custom physics simulations. I want to especially test this now due to Godot 4 introducing built in physics. This is a perfect oppurtunity to see where i should make a physics based game in.
 
 
## How will you determine there is a difference between the simulations?
This will be simply done by tracking the FPS at a specific time and writing them into a file. (More additions to track performance might be added soon)
